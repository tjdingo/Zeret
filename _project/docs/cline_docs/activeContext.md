# Active Context: Zeret Architecture Website

## Current Task
**GitHub Connection**

We are currently working on connecting the Zeret Architecture website project to GitHub for version control and collaboration. The GitHub repository has been created at [https://github.com/tjdingo/Zeret](https://github.com/tjdingo/Zeret).

## Task Details
1. GitHub repository: https://github.com/tjdingo/Zeret
2. GitHub user: tjdingo
3. Connection method: Using Git commands through terminal
4. Current Status: Setting up Git repository and pushing initial code

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank files in `/Users/thomasdings/Desktop/Zeret/cline_docs/`
- Analyzed existing project structure and files
- Identified homepage HTML file (`zeret-homepage-html.html`) as initial content to push

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Git repository in Zeret directory (if not already done)
2. Add GitHub remote repository as origin
3. Stage files for initial commit
4. Make initial commit with descriptive message
5. Push to GitHub repository
6. Verify successful connection and push

## Notes
- Visual Studio Code GitHub integration is already set up and signed in
- Only the homepage has been created so far - other pages will need to be developed
- The project is in early stages with just homepage HTML, mockups, and planning documents
- File organization should follow best practices for web development
