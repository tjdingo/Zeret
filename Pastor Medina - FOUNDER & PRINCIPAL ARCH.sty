Terez Villeda - Head Designer
As a designer, my goal is to connect with my audience
emotionally, and be able to impact their lives similarly
to how design affected my own. Having passion and
never-ending curiosity are what drive my love for
design.
As a graduate of Rhode Island School of Design , I am
currently working as a freelance Brand Designer based
in NYC and Boston.
In addition to design, I have always had a deep-rooted
love for music and thrive off sharing my new findings
with my friends and family. If Iâ€™m not curating
playlists, you can find me surfing, snowboarding,
trying a reviewed New York Times restaurant, or
snuggled up on my couch reading a book!
